控制饮食

　　Are you having difficulty following diets? Our lives are way more complex than those which allow us to stick to a monotonous restrictive diet. Food psychologist Ridhi Golechha (里迪•格莱查)said, If all of us could follow diets: we'd all have reached our goals. Real-life stresses such as lockdown anxiety, relationship conflicts, workload, financial stresses, exasperating parenting, teenage drama：and so much more directly impact how we feel and by virtue：what we eat. If: on paper：diets were so easy to follow, then we'd all be part of that tiny ten percent of people in the world (athletes, models, or actresses)- who are permanently fit.'

　　We all know of those rough days when all we want is too drown our faces in a tub of ice cream or reach out for that melting chocolate cake. "Emotional eating is nothing but eating our emotions. We're all human with emotions and hunger. By that definition, all of us are emotional eaters, we turn to food when we re overwhelmed with anger, sadness;frustration;or any other significant emotion：explained Ridhi.

　　There Ts a reason why the butterfly comes back to suck sweet nectar from the flowers, in turn pollinating the rest of the garden. Humans：much like animals. Birds, and insects, are hardwired for pleasure. But here's the catch: we humans are afraid of cheesy Pizza：they'll be overwhelmed with pleasure, lose control, and end up finishing the whole Pizza. We fear this would result in a failed diet, weight gain：and massive guilt：so we avoid it altogether. But, it doesn't work.

　　Biology suggests otherwise. Like every other species: homo sapiens were also built for survival. It is pleasure that drives humans to repeat the feel-good behaviour endlessly— explained Ridhi.

　　When does emotional eating become worrisome? "Largely：there's nothing wrong with that. We do eat to manage and cope with our feelings, especially those that don't feel so good because eating itself is so biologically rewarding. It's completely okay if we're doing it once in a while, because as I said we're all evolutionarily wired to emotional eating. However, if we re constantly depending on food to swallow our difficult emotions and discomforts, leaving us with a feeling of guilt constantly at the end of it: then definitely, we need to work on it”：said Ridhi.

　　What can we do to reduce emotional eating? According to Ridhi：the reason we fail diets is that we try to fight biology and suppress our emotions, which only works temporarily. To make long-lasting changes, we must address the toot causes of emotional eating. Here are a few tips to get you started:

　　First, don't skip meals. Starring often confuses your biological hunger drives and makes you more vulnerable to eat your emotions. Second understand the difference between actual physical hunger versus emotional hunger. Third, make a list of the top three emotions you feel weakly and start finding different ways to cope with them. Fourth，talk to an expert. It's better not to ignore your emotional eating since it can later cause health issues like different that will take away your urge by distracting you momentarily.

　　Emotional eating is a message that reveals a deeper problem. Understanding yourself and the way you eat can address the root causes and enable you to live a life that is beyond food obsessions and the fear of failing your diets.

　　人口普查

　　2020年11月中国开始了第七次人工普查。人口普查将为开启全面建设社会主义现代化 国家新征程提供科学准确的统计信息支持。

　　人口普查是推动经济高质量发展的内在需求。当前，我国经济正处于转变发展方式，优 化经济结构转换増长动力的攻关期。及时查清人口数量、结构和分布这一基本国情，摸清人 力资源结构信息，才能够更加准确地把握需求结构、城乡结构、区域结构、产业结构等状况， 为推动经济高质量发展，建设现代化经济体系提供有力的支持。

　　人口普查，是完善人口发展战略和政策体系，促进人口长期均衡发展的迫切需要。自 2010年第六次全国人口普查以来,我国人口发展的内在动力和外部条件发生了显著改变。人口总规模増长减缓，劳动年龄人口波动下降，老龄化程度不断加深。全面查清我国人口数量、结构、分布、城乡住房等方面的最 新情况，了解人口增长、劳动力供给、流动人口变化 情况，摸清老年人口规模，为制定和完善未来收入、消费、教育、就业、养老、医疗、社会保障等政策措施提供基础，也为教育和医疗机构布局、儿童和老人服务设施建设、工商业服 务网点分布、城乡道路建设等提供依据。

　　人口普查工作从方案制定、物资准备、试点、人员培训、入户登记到数据处理等一切工 作都离不开人，队伍建设非常重要。能否组织好人口普查队伍，能否做好普查人员的选调， 直接影响到普查的工作质量和数据质量。
